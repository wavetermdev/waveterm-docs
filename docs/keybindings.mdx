Here's the set of default keybindings available in Wave.  It is split into sections.
Some keybindings are always active.  Others are only active for certain types of blocks.

Note that these are the MacOS keybindings (they use "Cmd").  For Windows and Linux
replace "Cmd" with "Alt" (note that "Ctrl" is "Ctrl" on both Mac, Windows, and Linux).
