* Fixes windows SSH connections (invalid path while trying to install wsh tools)

### v0.8.6 &mdash; Sep 26, 2024

Another quick hotfix update. Fixes an issue where, if you deleted all of the tabs in a window, the window would be restored on next startup as completely blank.

Also, as a bonus, we added fish shell support!

### v0.8.5 &mdash; Sep 25, 2024

Hot fix, dowgrade `jotai` library.  Upgrading caused a major regression in codeedit which did not allow

### v0.8.3 &mdash; Sep 25, 2024

More hotfixes for Linux users.  We now link against an older version of glibc and use
the zig compiler on linux (the newer version caused us not to run on older distros).  
Also fixes a permissions issue when installing via .deb.  There is also a new config value
`window:nativetitlebar` which restores the native titlebar on windows/linux.


### v0.8.2 &mdash; Sep 24, 2024

Hot fix, fixes a nasty crash on startup for Linux users (dynamic linking but with netcgo DNS library)

### v0.8.0 &mdash; Sep 20, 2024

**Major New Relase of Wave Terminal**

The new build is a fresh start, and a clean break from the current version. As such, your history, settings, and configuration will not be carried over. If you'd like to continue to run the legacy version, you will need to download it separately.
