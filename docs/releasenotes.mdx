# Release Notes

### v0.9.0 &mdash; Oct 28, 2024

New major Wave Terminal release!  Wave tabs are now cached.  Tab switching performance is
now much faster and webview state, editor state, and scroll positions are now persisted
across tab changes.  We also have native WSL2 support.  You can create native Wave connections
to your Windows WSL2 distributions using the connection button.

We've also laid the groundwork for some big features that will be released over the
next couple of weeks, including Workspaces, AI improvments, and custom widgets.

Lots of other smaller changes and bug fixes.  See full list of PRs at https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/releases/tag/v0.9.0
