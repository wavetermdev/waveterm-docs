# Release Notes

### v0.8.7 &mdash; Sep 30, 2024

Quick patch release to fix bugs:

* Fixes windows SSH connections (invalid path while trying to install wsh tools)
* Fixes an issue resolving `~` in windows paths `~\` now works instead of just `~/`
* Tries to fix background color for webpages.  Pulls meta tag for color-scheme, and sets a black background if dark detected (fixes issue rendering raw githubusercontent files)
* Fixed our useDimensions hook to fire correctly. Fixes some sizing issues including allowing error messages to show consistently when SSH connections fail.
* Allow "data:" urls in custom tab backgrounds
* All the alias "tab" for the current tab's UUID when using wsh
* [BUILD] conditional write generated files only if they are updated

### v0.8.6 &mdash; Sep 26, 2024

Another quick hotfix update. Fixes an issue where, if you deleted all of the tabs in a window, the window would be restored on next startup as completely blank.

Also, as a bonus, we added fish shell support!

### v0.8.5 &mdash; Sep 25, 2024

Hot fix, dowgrade `jotai` library.  Upgrading caused a major regression in codeedit which did not allow
users to edit files.

### v0.8.4 &mdash; Sep 25, 2024

* Added a setting `window:disablehardwareacceleration` to disable native hardware acceleration
* New startup model for legacy users given them the option to download the WaveLegacy
* Use WAVETERM_HOME for the home directory consistently

### v0.8.3 &mdash; Sep 25, 2024

More hotfixes for Linux users.  We now link against an older version of glibc and use
the zig compiler on linux (the newer version caused us not to run on older distros).  
Also fixes a permissions issue when installing via .deb.  There is also a new config value
`window:nativetitlebar` which restores the native titlebar on windows/linux.


### v0.8.2 &mdash; Sep 24, 2024

Hot fix, fixes a nasty crash on startup for Linux users (dynamic linking but with netcgo DNS library)

### v0.8.1 &mdash; Sep 23, 2024

Minor cleanup release.

* fix number parsing for certain config file values
* add link to docs site
* add new back button for directory view
* telemetry fixes

### v0.8.0 &mdash; Sep 20, 2024

**Major New Relase of Wave Terminal**

The new build is a fresh start, and a clean break from the current version. As such, your history, settings, and configuration will not be carried over. If you'd like to continue to run the legacy version, you will need to download it separately.
