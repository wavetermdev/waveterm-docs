# wsh command

The `wsh` command is always available from Wave blocks.  It is a powerful tool for interacting with Wave blocks and can bridge data between your CLI and the widget GUIs.

---

## view
You can open a preview block with the contents of any file or directory by running:

```
wsh view [path]
```

You can use this command to easily preview images, markdown files, and directories.  For code/text files this will open
a codeedit block which you can use to quickly edit the file using Wave's embedded graphical editor.

---

## edit

```
wsh edit [path]
```

This will open up codeedit for the specified file.  This is useful for quickly editing files on a local or remote machine in our graphical editor.  This command will wait until the file is closed before exiting (unlike \`view\`) so you can set your \`$EDITOR\` to \`wsh editor\` for a seamless experience.  You can combine this with a \`-m\` flag to open the editor in magnified mode.

---

## getmeta

You can view the metadata of any block by running:

```
wsh getmeta [blockid]
```

This is especially useful for preview and web blocks as you can see the file or url that they are pointing to and use that in your CLI scripts.

---

## setmeta

You can update any metadata key value pair for blocks (and tabs) by using the setmeta command:

```
wsh setmeta [blockid] [key]=[value]
wsh setmeta [blockid] file=~/myfile.txt
wsh setmeta [blockid] url=https://waveterm.dev/
```

You can get block and tab ids by right clicking on the appropriate block and selecting "Copy BlockId".  When you
update the metadata for a preview or web block you'll see the changes reflected instantly in the block.

Other useful metadata values to override block titles, icons, colors, themes, etc.

---

## deleteblock

```
wsh deleteblock [blockid]
```

This will delete the block with the specified id.

---

## ssh

```
wsh ssh [user@host]
```

This will use Wave's internal ssh implementation to connect to the specified remote machine.

---

## web

You can search for a given url using:

```
wsh web <url>
```

Alternatively, you can search with the configured search engine using:

```
wsh web <search query>
```

Both of these commands will open a new web block with the desired page.

---

## conn

This has several subcommands which all perform various features related to connections.

### status

```
wsh conn status
```
This command gives the status of all connections made since waveterm started.

### reinstall

```
wsh conn reinstall [user@host]
```

This command reinstalls the Wave Shell Extensions on the specified connection.

### disconnect

```
wsh conn disconnect [user@host]
```

This command completely disconnects the specified connection. This will apply to all blocks where the connection is being used

### connect

```
wsh conn connect [user@host]
```

This command connects to the specified connection but does not create a block for it.

### ensure

```
wsh conn ensure [user@host]
```

This command connects to the specified connection if it isn't already connected.
