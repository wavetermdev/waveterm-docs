# wsh command

The `wsh` command is always available from Wave blocks.  It is a powerful tool for interacting with Wave blocks and can bridge data between your CLI and the widget GUIs.

---

## view
You can open a preview block with the contents of any file or directory by running:

```
wsh view [path]
```

You can use this command to easily preview images, markdown files, and directories.  For code/text files this will open
a codeedit block which you can use to quickly edit the file using Wave's embedded graphical editor.

---

## edit

```
wsh edit [path]
```

This will open up codeedit for the specified file.  This is useful for quickly editing files on a local or remote machine in our graphical editor.  This command will wait until the file is closed before exiting (unlike \`view\`) so you can set your \`$EDITOR\` to \`wsh editor\` for a seamless experience.  You can combine this with a \`-m\` flag to open the editor in magnified mode.

---

## getmeta

You can view the metadata of any block by running:

```
wsh getmeta -b [blockid]
```

This is especially useful for preview and web blocks as you can see the file or url that they are pointing to and use that in your CLI scripts.

blockid format:

* this -- the current block (this is also the default)
* tab -- the id of the current tab
* d6ff4966-231a-4074-b78a-20acc7226b41 -- a full blockid is a UUID
* a67f55a3 -- blockids may be truncated to the first 8 characters
* 5 -- if a number less than 100 is given, it is a block number.  blocks are numbered sequentially in the current tab from the top-left to bottom-right.  holding Ctrl:Shift will show a block number overlay.

---

## setmeta

You can update any metadata key value pair for blocks (and tabs) by using the setmeta command:

```
wsh setmeta -b [blockid] [key]=[value]
wsh setmeta -b [blockid] file=~/myfile.txt
wsh setmeta -b [blockid] url=https://waveterm.dev/
```

You can get block and tab ids by right clicking on the appropriate block and selecting "Copy BlockId" (or use the block number via Ctrl:Shift).  When you
update the metadata for a preview or web block you'll see the changes reflected instantly in the block.

Other useful metadata values to override block titles, icons, colors, themes, etc.

---

## deleteblock

```
wsh deleteblock -b [blockid]
```

This will delete the block with the specified id.

---

## ssh

```
wsh ssh [user@host]
```

This will use Wave's internal ssh implementation to connect to the specified remote machine.

---

## web

You can search for a given url using:

```
wsh web <url>
```

Alternatively, you can search with the configured search engine using:

```
wsh web <search query>
```

Both of these commands will open a new web block with the desired page.

---

## conn

This has several subcommands which all perform various features related to connections.

### status

```
wsh conn status
```
This command gives the status of all connections made since waveterm started.

### reinstall

```
wsh conn reinstall [user@host]
```

This command reinstalls the Wave Shell Extensions on the specified connection.

### disconnect

```
wsh conn disconnect [user@host]
```

This command completely disconnects the specified connection. This will apply to all blocks where the connection is being used

### connect

```
wsh conn connect [user@host]
```

This command connects to the specified connection but does not create a block for it.

### ensure

```
wsh conn ensure [user@host]
```

This command connects to the specified connection if it isn't already connected.

### setconfig

```
wsh setconfig [config name]=[config value]
```

This allows setting various options in the `config/settings.json` file. It will check to be sure a valid config option was provided.
